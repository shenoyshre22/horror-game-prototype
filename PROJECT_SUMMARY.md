## Core Game Concept

### Setting
**Abandoned School** (PES-Inspired)
- Ground Floor (Spawn + Cafeteria + Gym)
- 1st Floor (Classrooms + Library)
- 2nd Floor (Classrooms + Staff Rooms)
- 3rd Floor (Science Labs + Principal's Office)
- Basement (Dark, dangerous, legendary weapons)

### Gameplay Loop
1. **Spawn** with 5 lives in the school
2. **Explore** floors to find better weapons
3. **Survive** ghoul attacks and blackouts
4. **Compete** with other players for resources
5. **Last player standing wins**

### Core Features

#### 1. Progressive Weapon System
```
Ground Floor ‚Üí Basic Melee (pipes, bats)
1st Floor    ‚Üí Upgraded Melee + Throwables
2nd Floor    ‚Üí Mid-Tier Ranged (crossbow, flare gun)
3rd Floor    ‚Üí High-Tier Firearms (shotgun)
Basement     ‚Üí Legendary (holy water, chainsaw)
```

#### 2. Dynamic Lighting & Blackouts
- **Normal**: Ceiling lights illuminate areas
- **Blackouts**: Random power outages (30-90 seconds)
- **Torch**: Battery-powered personal light
- **Strategy**: Conserve battery for blackouts

#### 3. Multiple Ghoul Types
- **Wanderer**: Basic patrol enemy (common)
- **Stalker**: Invisible in darkness (uncommon)
- **Screamer**: Fast, spawns during blackouts (uncommon)
- **Brute**: Tank guarding key areas (rare)
- **The Headmaster**: Boss with special abilities (legendary)

#### 4. Player Systems
- **Health**: 100 HP, healed with med kits
- **Lives**: 5 per player, respawn when lost
- **Stamina**: For sprinting and melee attacks
- **Sanity**: Depletes in darkness, causes hallucinations

#### 5. Multiplayer
- **2-8 Players**: Competitive survival
- **Online/Local**: Both supported
- **Lobby System**: Host/join with custom settings
- **Voice Chat**: Proximity-based (planned)

## Technical Implementation

### Godot Engine 4.2+
- **Rendering**: Forward+ renderer
- **Networking**: Built-in multiplayer API
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Platform**: PC (Windows/Linux/macOS)

### Core Systems Implemented

#### GameManager Singleton
```gdscript
- Game state machine (MENU, LOBBY, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER)
- Player data tracking (lives, score, alive status)
- Win/lose condition checking
- Event system via signals
```

**Key Functions:**
- `add_player(id, name)` - Register players
- `player_lose_life(id)` - Handle death/respawn
- `start_game()` - Begin match
- `_end_game(winner_id)` - Declare winner

#### NetworkManager Singleton
```gdscript
- Server creation and client connection
- Player registration and synchronization
- RPC calls for game state sync
- Network event handling
```

**Key Functions:**
- `create_server(port)` - Host game
- `join_server(address, port)` - Join game
- `register_player(name)` - Sync player data
- Network RPCs for position, health, ghouls

### Input Configuration
All controls pre-configured in project.godot:
- **Movement**: W/A/S/D
- **Combat**: Mouse buttons, R to reload
- **Interaction**: E, F for torch
- **System**: Tab, M, ESC

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (4-6 weeks)

‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (6 documents)  
‚úÖ Development roadmap and priorities  
‚úÖ Technical implementation guide  

### What's Next (Phase 1 - MVP)
1. **Player Controller** - Movement, camera, health, lives
2. **Basic Level** - Single floor school layout
3. **Torch System** - Flashlight with battery management
4. **Basic Ghoul** - Wanderer AI with patrol and chase
5. **Melee Weapon** - Pipe weapon with durability
6. **UI/HUD** - Health, lives, weapon display
7. **Win/Lose** - Last player standing logic

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. PES-Inspired Architecture
School design based on real Pune Educational Society schools for authenticity and nostalgia.

### 2. Floor-Based Progression
Risk/reward system: higher floors = better weapons + more dangerous ghouls.

### 3. 5 Lives System
Balance between permadeath tension and forgiveness for mistakes.

### 4. Random Blackouts
Creates unpredictable tension moments, forces strategic battery management.

### 5. Competitive Survival
Players compete for resources while cooperating against ghouls.

### 6. 20-Minute Matches
Optimal match length: enough time for progression, not too long for repetition.

## Innovation Points
