## Next Development Steps

If you're contributing to development, here's what needs to be done next:

### 1. Player Controller (Priority 1)
- Create `scenes/Player.tscn`
- Implement `scripts/Player.gd` with:
  - Character movement (WASD)
  - Camera control (mouse look)
  - Sprint system with stamina
  - Health and lives system

### 2. Basic Level (Priority 2)
- Create `scenes/GameLevel.tscn`
- Design a simple single-floor school layout
- Add basic geometry and collision
- Set up navigation mesh for AI

### 3. Torch System (Priority 3)
- Implement flashlight/torch in `scripts/Torch.gd`
- Add battery system
- Create UI for battery indicator

### 4. Basic Ghoul (Priority 4)
- Create `scenes/Ghoul.tscn`
- Implement `scripts/Ghoul.gd` with:
  - Basic AI patrol behavior
  - Player detection
  - Chase and attack logic

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available:

- **[README.md](README.md)**: Project overview and features
- **[GAME_DESIGN.md](GAME_DESIGN.md)**: Complete game design document
- **[GAMEPLAY.md](GAMEPLAY.md)**: Detailed gameplay mechanics and systems
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**: Development timeline and phases
- **[IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)**: Technical implementation notes

## Testing

### Currently Available Tests
None yet - project is in documentation phase

### Planned Testing
- Unit tests for game systems (GameManager, NetworkManager)
- Integration tests for multiplayer
- Playtesting for balance

## Contributing

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or suggest features
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Tag appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)

### Pull Requests
- Follow the development roadmap priorities
- Ensure code follows GDScript style guidelines
- Test your changes before submitting
- Update documentation if needed

### Code Style
- Use tabs for indentation (Godot default)
- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Project failed to load"
- Ensure you have Godot 4.2 or later
- Check that `project.godot` is in the root directory

#### "Autoload scripts not found"
- Ensure `GameManager.gd` is in `scripts/` folder
- Ensure `NetworkManager.gd` is in `scripts/` folder
- Restart Godot after creating the scripts

#### "Cannot run the game"
- Main scene not set yet (normal for current development stage)
- Will be fixed when scenes are created
